Setup/wiring:
(Fo AT Mode)EN/KEY Pin - 3.3V
VCC - 5V
GND - GND
RX - Pin 0(RX)(must be 3.3V; Since Arduino pins have 5V logic, a voltage divider is needed)
TX - Pin 1(TX)

The Voltage Divider setup for the RX pin of the bluetooth module should be:
RX(BT)---1kΩ
          |
          |---RX(ARduino)
          |
         2kΩ---GND

Entering AT Mode - Connect the EN key to Arduino's 3.3V Pin and then power on t he BT Module. Slow blinks 2 seconds apart indicates that the BT module is in AT mode.

To setup the master BT Module:
  *Enter master BT's AT mode*
  1.Get the address of the slave module (by entering AT+ADDR? in slave module's AT mode)
  2.Set master BT's role to master (AT+ROLE=1; optionally, verify with AT+ROLE?)
  3.Set cmode to 0 so that the master module only connects to one pre-selected device (the slave BT module) (AT+CMODE=0)
  4.Set the slave BT as the device the master BT should connect to (AT+BIND=Address of slave BT with colons replaced with commas)
  5.Power down the master BT and disconnect the EN pin.
  Next Power up, the master BT module should automatically connect to the slave module if it is online
