The sketch assumes the following setup/wiring:
Trigger Pin - Pin 12
Echo Pin - Pin 13
(JSN...)Sensor must be at least 20cm away from a reference suface (e.g. the glass of the aquarium)

Crude experimentation shows that the following values are suitable for the two Ultrasonic sensors candidate to be used for the project,
HC-SR04 being the non water proofed sensor.

Ultrasonic sensor
Model       Delay(ms)       degree of freedom (+-; allowable discrepancy between distance reads before it counts as fish movement)
SR04              30                            5
JSN...        50/100                        10/15
